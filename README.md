This project is meant to read flat files into an appropriate data set in R. The focus is to do a cleanup of the data as best as possible. A tidy data set has been created and summarized.

1. The data was downloaded and placed in a data folder
2. Data was unzipped and read into R
3. Data was arranged into dataframes and summarized


It really is not meant to be too complicated.
The codebook provides more information on the dataset.
